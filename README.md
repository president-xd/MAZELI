# MAZELI

A Maze Solver game written in C# that uses the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the goal in a maze. This game provides an interactive interface where players can input their maze and watch the BFS algorithm in action as it solves the puzzle.

## Features

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm for solving the maze.
- Visual representation of the maze and the solving process.
- User-friendly interface for inputting maze data.
- Step-by-step solution highlighting the path from start to finish.

## Requirements

- **.NET Core 5.0** or later.
- **Visual Studio 2019** or later (for development and debugging).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the Maze Solver repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/president-xd/mazeli.git
```
### 2. Open the Project
Open the **MazeGenerator.sln** file in Visual Studio

### 3. Build the Project
In Visual Studio, go to **Build** menu and selection **Build Solution**. This will compile the project

### 4. Run the MAZELI

## How BFS Works
Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores the maze level by level. Starting from the S point, BFS checks all neighboring cells and marks the path until it reaches the goal G. BFS guarantees the shortest path because it explores all possible routes level by level.
